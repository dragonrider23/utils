# Golang Utility Functions

This package contains several functions that I've found useful in my programs. They're usually small little things that could trivially be implemented by just about anyone, but I'd rather not reinvent the wheel.

This package is released under the MIT License.

This package follows semantic versioning. Backwards compatibility breaks are noted by a bump in the major version number. A single new function or bug fix is a bump in patch. A large batch of new functions is a bump in major.
